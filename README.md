## A modern livestock farm Project.
### Project Overview
This project implements PL/SQL window functions to analyze farm sales data. It models a modern livestock farm with customers, products, and transactions. The system provides insights such as top products, customer quartiles, sales growth, and moving averages.
### Problem Definition
1.	Business Context: A modern livestock farm that houses cattle, goats, chickens, ducks, and turkeys in various locations.
2.	Data Challenge: Daily sales reports don't show management how sales are changing across different regions, which products are the best sellers, or how each branch is performing.
3.	Expected Outcome: To increase revenue, use analytics to identify the best products, monitor sales patterns, and enhance farm operations.
